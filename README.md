### Prerequisites

Just two!

- FFMPEG, either in the same folder as GUI.py or added to PATH/Environment Variables
```

## Usage

1. Run GUI.py with FFMPEG installed and in your PATH

2. Choose your input video

3. Choose your output video name AND FILE EXTENSION

4. Press Convert 
<!---//(TODO: rename that, while it does convert, the name of that button and the repo title disagree)
